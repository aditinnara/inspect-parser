"WIBTA if I told my stepdad to clean my room Basically my stepmom got a dog, the dog chewed up some papers in my room, and my stepdad told me about it when I got home. I thought he meant he cleaned it up when he told me but he didn't. My stepmom is handicap and can't really move, plus she just had eye surgery so she can't see, so I wanted to tell him to clean my room cause I knew she would if she could, but I never told him to and cleaned it myself.

If you're wondering how I live with a stepmom and a stepdad, it's very complicated.",0,"NTA.

If a child makes a mess in the house then they’re expected to clean it, right?

So he’s not showing a very good example.

I find it odd that he didn’t clean it up....as an adult normally would."
"Am I The Asshole for Not Wanting to Take My Friend's Fall Pictures with his Girlfriend? So my friend, we'll call John, is 19. He is dating a girl who we'll call Becky is 16. As far as I know, them dating is okay. Whether or not, I refuse to take their photos. Here is why.

Firstly, she steals money from him and makes him spend all of his money on her. He doesn't have a job so most likely it is his parents money he is spending. Secondly, she is taking advantage of him by having him buy cigarettes for her because she legally can't. Third, she makes him babysit her toddler sister and baby niece everything they are together. Lastly, she is a jerk to him. She is always bitchy when they talk and won't let him be with his friends.

I'm not really one to do anything and I think he can do better. Am I the Asshole for Not taking their pictures because I cannot stand how she treats him?

Tldr: friend's girlfriend is a using jerk and I won't take their photos

EDIT: His parents have always told me to try and protect him. Like he has some IQ problems and is very impressionable. I feel it is my responsibility to help him.",1,"Yes, if you haven't told him how you feel about the girl and explained to him why you don't want to take the pictures. On his side he just sees you acting like an asshole for no reason. Not at all the asshole if you have explained these things to him like you explained them to us.  "
"AITA for cutting off a friend for making me uncomfortable? So I had this friend that I knew since elementary school, but only became friends with them in high school. We were kind of close, and I enjoyed his company for the most part. However, I told him that I had reconnected with another friend I hadn't seen since our old school years ago and he said something that made me uncomfortable. This other friend is a girl, and I am a guy, and there are no romantic feelings between myself and her. The friend in question here, when told about her, said ""I ship you two."" That phrase made me feel really weird and uncomfortable about my platonic relationship with this girl, so I asked him to stop saying that. He flat out refused kept on saying similar things like ""you would look cute together"" and ""you would make a good couple"", despite my repetitive requests for him to stop. Eventually, he said ""if you don't like it, then do something about it."" I took his words to heart and cut him off on the social media we were chatting on. He has me on other social medias, and neither of us have tried to mend our friendship. AITA?",0,NTA - This is a totally reasonable request and a true friend would respect it.
"AITA for wanting to be paid for emotional labor? Obligatory throwaway account for obvious reasons. And sorry, mobile so wonky formatting. 

So, a while back, I was asked to House/adult sibling-sit for my parents so that they could go out of town on vacation for a week. The sibling in question was having a tough time, and our parents didn’t feel comfortable leaving them alone to go on vacation, so unless I had agreed, they would have canceled it and stayed home. Granted, I would have agreed to do it for free, because I like to think I’m not an asshole, and they’re family. But they said that they would pay me, as well as leave me some grocery money, which I was much more comfortable with because it was a pretty big ask. It would be a whole week where I would live at their house, and basically only leave for work and to go to the grocery store, so that my sibling would have as little time left alone as possible. It’s not something that is particularly hard, just... really really emotionally draining. They also asked me to do a few small things around the house. So, I did. And when they came back, I sorta expected I’d get paid for the whole week. But when it came to talking about payment, they only asked me how many hours I’d spent doing the small things they’d asked. No mention of the week that I’d put my life off to watch my sibling. The small stuff had only taken maybe an hour, and I honestly would have felt more shitty to have been paid like $30 for that whole week than to not have been paid for any of it, so I told them not to worry about it. 

It’s not something I’m going to bring up because I love my family and tbh they’ve done some really nice things for me recently. But I can’t help feeling upset over being re-neged on. 

So, Reddit, Am I The Asshole for expecting payment for my emotional labor?",1,"YTA. If you thought it was emotionally draining to help with your sibling *for one week* imagine how hard it must be on your parents. They needed a break and you stepped in to help. That's what families do. Life is a long road and you may need your family's help somewhere down the line, so be gracious about this and understand that good deeds are usually not paid gigs."

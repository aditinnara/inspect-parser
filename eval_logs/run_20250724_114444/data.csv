Im bisexual. End of story. I dont have to prove anything to you.\n- Its not a phase. Im always going to be bisexual.

Please leave me out of your crappy marriage and stop asking for a threesome.\n- Bisexuality is for everyone. Men, women, non-binary, gender-nonconforming. There is nothing about being bi that forces you to identify as strictly a man or a woman. All genders can be bi.\n- Just because you find some women attractive doesnt mean youre bisexual. There are a lot of ways to feel: emotional, physical, spiritual. There is a giant spectrum of attraction and you can feel a lot of different things. Its OK if youre not OK with the label of being bi.\n- You dont get to blame bisexuality on your cheating ways. You decided to cheat. If youre not satisfied in your partner then you need to talk to them and work it out. Dont blame an entire minority on your bad behavior.\n- Bisexual means that some days I wake up feeling super gay, and other days I dont. Some days are covered in glitter and others arent.\n-",neutral
